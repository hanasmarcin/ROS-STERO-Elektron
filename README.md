# ROS STERO Elektron

Project made in the Robot Control and Simulation classes, using ROS, Python and C++. It consisted of two laboratory tasks and two projects:

- _Laboratory 1_ - ROS node implementing a relative position control (moving from origin to goal point based on a movement time calculation and robot's odometry)
- _Project 1_ - ROS node calculating odometry errors (using a tune controller, a differential drive controller and a laser scan matcher)
- _Laboratory 2_ - GAZEBO environments (several rooms for robot to move around) as well as maps created using gmapping
- _Project 2_ - ROS node implementing planner structure, that consisted of trajectory generation, recovery behavior in case of entrapment and robot's movement to the goal along the path.

Launch files were created and every component was then visualised in RVIZ as well as in GAZEBO.

Further description (in polish) in project's report in the pdf format.
